<title>Owain's Blog - Hello World!</title>
<p align="right"><strong class="red">Hello World!</strong><br />
Tuesday 19th May, 2020</p>

<p>This blog post marks the slow and gradual consolidation of my life in
lockdown. I am very grateful to be the sort of person who is, strangely,
<em>thriving</em> given our circumstances. I am exuding airs of
effortless middle-class-ness, with my perenially clean flat, endless
video-calls and sourdough baking.</p>

<p>When I first moved to Southampton five years ago, homesteading wasn't
on my mind. Fresh out of university, I had yet to really comprehend
living independently in one place for more than a year. Subsequently, as
my weekends piled up with fun things with friends in other cities, I let
my flat pile up with garbage, junk and trash.</p>

<p>Only through the constance of working from home and weekends alone
have I, <em>at last</em>, felt some semblance of ``real adulthood''.
Things are neatly organised. Food cupboards are stocked. Laundry is
neatly folded. Books are read. Wine is not merely consumed, but
<em>collected</em>.</p>

<p>The most silver of all the linings of this bastard situation We The
Planet find ourselves in currently though -- is that I am discovering how
little I <em>actually need</em>.</p>

<p>On a technical segue -- this is precisely why this blog now
exists. I have moved my homepage from a $5/month
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/2c63d92a268d" target="_new">DigitalOcean Droplet</a> to an
old Raspberry Pi 2 I found in a box, and I'm Outsourcing all the hard
stuff to CloudFlare. I'm following Fabien Sandglard's
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html" target="_new">0x10 rules</a>.
Any content generation is done with a couple of short bash scripts.</p>
